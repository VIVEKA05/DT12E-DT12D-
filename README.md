# DT12E-DT12D-
DT12E (Encoder) and DT12D (Decoder) form a 12-bit RF remote control pair used for secure wireless data transmission. The DT12E converts parallel input data into serial format for RF transmission, while the DT12D receives and decodes the signal back into parallel outputs, enabling reliable remote switching and control applications.
